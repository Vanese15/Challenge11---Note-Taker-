// ## Getting Started
// On the back end, the application should include a `db.json` file that 
// will store and retrieve notes using the `fs` module.

// You'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved (look into npm packages that could do this for you).
// ## Bonus
// You havenâ€™t learned how to handle DELETE requests, but this application offers that functionality on the front end. 
// As a bonus, try to add the DELETE route to the application using the following guideline:
// * `DELETE /api/notes/:id` should receive a query parameter that contains the id of a note to delete. 
// To delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the `db.json` file, remove the note with the given `id` property, and then rewrite the notes to the `db.json` file.
